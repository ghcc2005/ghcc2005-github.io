## Markdown
Here I will give some often used markdown syntax. 

### Headings
To do headings you simply need to use the hashtag before the text. For example:
```
# Text (gives the text with <h1> style)
## Text (gives the text with <h2> style)
.
.
.
###### text (gives <h6>)
```
This is an example shown in action
#### h4 Text
##### h5 Text

### Lists
#### Un-ordered lists
To do un-ordered list you simply need to add either a "-" or "*" at the start of the list. By indenting the "-" or "*" the list is also indented. For example:
```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  * Item 3
  * Item 4
```
This is the example shown above in action
- Item 1
- Item 2
  * Item 3
  * Item 4

#### Ordered lists
To do Ordered list you simply need to add "1.", "2.", ... "n." to the start of the list. Same with un-ordered lists if you indent the numbers the list will also be indented. For example:
```
1. First
2. Second
3. Thrid
 1. Alpha
 2. Bravo
```
This is the example shown above in action
1. Dog
   1. German Shepherd
   2. Belgian Shepherd

### Emphasis
Here we will show you how to do italic, bold and bold italic. To do any of these we incase the word or text with either "*" or "_".
Example:
```
*Italic*
**Bold**
***Bold Italic***
```
Example in action:
*Italic*
**Bold**
***Bold Italic***
